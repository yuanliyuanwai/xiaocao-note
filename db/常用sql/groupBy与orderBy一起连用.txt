group by和order by一起连用的时候ORDER BY 子句中的列必须包含在聚合函数或 GROUP BY 子句中


错误做法
SELECT [col1] ,[col2] FROM [tb] GROUP BY [col1] ,[col2]  ORDER BY [col1] ,[col2] ,[col3]

正确做法
SELECT [col1] ,[col2],MAX([col3]) FROM [tb] GROUP BY [col1] ,[col2]  ORDER BY [col1] ,[col2] ,MAX([col3])
SELECT [col1] ,[col2],MAX([col3]) AS  [col3] FROM [tb] GROUP BY [col1] ,[col2]  ORDER BY [col1] ,[col2] ,[col3]
SELECT [col1] ,[col2] FROM [tb] GROUP BY [col1] ,[col2] ,[col3] ORDER BY [col1] ,[col2] ,[col3]
